I think this is a cool concept and in the future would replace YouTube due to the level of content it does present. but I’m a stickler for ease of use.",

They both primarily function to promote new content, but while the Home page is incredibly legible and engaging from a design point of view, the Explore page is super bland. \n\nAlso when i turn off my phone screen so i can just listen to the videos, they tend to randomly pause.

So stop pushing so hard the unrelated content I don’t care about on the front page. Beneath the giant hero image that displays the same content every time I open it, there’s a scrolling section of the latest videos uploaded to the entire platform. Why? As I said before, none of this content is relevant to me, and it also shows how little content there really is here, as it makes it clear there’s just not many uploads happening on any given day.\n\nThis is how I use Nebula: I watch YouTube. When I see an upload by someone who I know posts to Nebula, I’ll go there to watch it instead.  Oh wait, the front page is only irrelevant stuff. Where is subscriptions…oh right it’s called library. Go to library. Oh, I can only see 1.5 thumbnails in this view, with links to random other unused features. How to see all of the videos of my subscriptions in one place… must be “Followed Channels”. Oops, no, that’s just a static aphabetical list of the channels, with no way to sort by activity. Go back to the previous screen. Hmmm where is the right button…oh right that tiny low contrast “view more” that is barely noticable. NOW I can see the content I’m actually subscribing for.\n\nI probably would have just saved time by tapping next on the ads on the YouTube app.",

I like being able to “subscribe” to content creators the way one would on YouTube and the vast array of content is great.\n\nNow some problems I am having is the subtitles of videos are often wrong saying words the creators aren’t saying or even having a line of dialogue repeat even if the creator has moved on.\n\nAdditionally, even though Nebula is ad free— the ads creators place in their videos for when they get released on YouTube is still there.  Something that frankly is a silly thing to complain about but definitely impacts the experience.  I’m not paying for YouTube so I’m completely fine if a creator puts their ad for helix sleep in there.  I’m less fine with it in a paid subscription service and it robs the experience of a documentary/video essay streaming service making it feel like YouTube.\n\nAll in all, I love the idea and the lack of ads for my videos I like to watch is worth it but I wish there was more of a distinction between Nebula and YouTube because as it currently stands the platform feels like a mass patreon for YouTubers I like rather than anything of substantial merit.  Getting my videos ad free and early justify the price in my eyes but I can’t help but think about the fact that even on a paid platform I’m still having to fast forward through a patreon plug or a audible advertisement.",

As a test I searched a popular fitness topic that has has a lot of history and religion and philosophy behind it, yoga. There wasn't a single video. Nothing from a fitness instructor, nothing about the history of yoga in India and how it came to the Anglosphere, etc. all the results I got were for Baby Yoda or Baba Yaga. I didn't bother looking further, just cancelled my subscription and deleted the app. If it can't attract even one fitness instructor or non-Western historian to the service after 12 years I don't think it's worth the cost. At least YouTube, for all its flaws, has those.

      "content": "I love the concept of Nebula as a service, I enjoy the output of most of the creators and think the exclusive content on offer is very worthwhile. I want to love Nebula as a platform that empowers its creators and can give the audience more, but the issues I’ve run into with the app have made it difficult to consistently enjoy. The primary source of my issues has been with the podcast feature of the app, as I will often be listening to a podcast before it stops for a couple of minutes for seemingly no reason. Even me closing and reopening the app won’t get the podcast going again which ends up just causing me to use another app for podcasts while I drive or work. Sometimes I’ll download podcast episodes since I do a lot of traveling, only for me to open the app before my flight to find out all of my downloads have disappeared (despite me making sure they were downloaded the night before). The inconsistency with the podcast functions has been frustrating to say the least, as it has been easier to just listen to the content elsewhere than continue to engage with an app I desperately want to enjoy using.",

The creators on here are excellently curated, and I can click on pretty much any video and watch it all the way through. I also love how this platform also focuses on having queer, PoC, and other diverse voices, allowing them to create content that wouldn't be possible on something like YouTube. And there are so many creators I already watch on here, like Tale Foundry, Jessie Gender, Big Joel, Bright Sun Films, Kat Blaque, Hbomberguy, and surprisingly enough, Todd in the Shadows? \n\nIf you see a creator you follow on here and want to support them, I 100% urge you to subscribe. The rest of the content, even from the people you don't know, is sure to be just as good.",

      "content": "With the focus being on selling more subscription and making Nebula available on more platforms, this app is completely neglected and is a better YouTube Premium advocate than anyone. \n\nFirst of all, you can download videos for offline viewing, which is great, right? Well, guess what? The app often loses the downloaded content for no reason at all and you can literally see the downloaded videos just suddenly disappear right before your eyes when you need them the most. \n\nSecond, the TV app is also terrible. After you have scrolled down on a creator's video feed, what do you expect when you hit the back button? It should be the previous page. But not this app. It scrolls back up instead as \"back\" means undo. \n\nFinally, the UI/UX is simply messy and very unfriendly. There's no way to hide videos from a channel from being recommended. There's no good way to explore creators or videos similar to what you like. The server is extremely slow and it often hangs and doesn't load quickly (it's not the connection). \n\nAnyway, this app makes me wanna use YouTube Premium more than anything else.",
